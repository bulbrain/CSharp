language derives much of its syntax from C and C++ like C# but it has fewer low-level facilies than them.
C++ - is a general propose lenguage. It has imperative, object-oriented and generic programming features and also provides
facilities for low level memory manipulation. Its designed for system programming with performance, efficiency and 
flexibility of use as its design requirements. C# have been infuelced by C++.
PYTHON - Its a general propose, high-level lenguage. Its designed for code readability and its syntax allows programmers
to express concepts in fewer lines of code than other languages like C#. Its object-oriented, imperatove and have 
functional or procedural styles.
JAVASCRIPT - is a dynamic lenguage and its used mostly for web browsers to interact with the user with client-side scripts,
to comunicate with the browser, game devolpment and mobile or desktop applications. It sintax its influenced by C and it
